All credits go to Mr. John Muldoon, I am so impressed with his design, I am dedicated to build it.
Also a big shoutout to the people in the comments on thingiverse. They provide useful information, for example a link to a spring can be found there.
So the link to the spring is originated from **Thomas Jahn** https://www.thingiverse.com/energetics/designs


Intention
#########

After 10 very awsome videos about how to build the base, John did not have time to make further videos.
Life goes on and I am very thankful for what he released.

Still people are struggling finding all the non-printed parts, with electronics and also with programming.
I am now one of them strugglers, I still have a lot of missing parts, but i figured also some stuff out.
And I am capable of a little developing with the arduino IDE and have a test setup with a Teensy LC with some potis, switches and buttons.

So I will try to contribute what I have figured out during the last week printing this masterpiece of engineering.
Where you get the parts from is probably very dependent from where you live. I am coming from switzerland which is therfore the country where I try to buy my parts.
But to be honest, lots of the things are directly shipped from china anyways.


Structure
#########

I will to somehow split this up in a way which makes sense.

**A list of all links that John already provides **

**Hardware and Parts**

**Wiring and development**

**Code**
The code itself of course, happy to share it.
It is not much right now anyway and I believe, this is some very basic stuff. Not hard to change and adapt.
