Potentiometer
_____________

You will need two potentiometer, with two different shaft length. The one for the collective, built into the base, is the short 15mm shaft.
The longer 25 (mine did not arrive yet, probably to long but you can shorten this one)

- Aluminium pipe
    - Outer Diameter 32mm / Inner Diameter 29mm / Thickness 1.5mm
- Bearings
    - Outer Diameter 22mm / Inner Diameter 10mm / Width 7mm
- Spring
    - Inner Diameter 14mm / Right End Length max 6cm / Lower End Length max 5cm
    - The thickness, therfore the strength is probably different for different people.
      This is the spring which should work very well. The spring should be straight, to have load in the down position. https://www.sodemann-federn.de/t095-090-453r
